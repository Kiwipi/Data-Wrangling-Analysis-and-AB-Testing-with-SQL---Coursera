Exercise 1: Figure out how many tests we have running right now
  SELECT 
      COUNT(DISTINCT parameter_value) AS tests
  FROM 
      dsv1069.events
  WHERE 
      event_name= 'test_assignment'
  AND 
      parameter_name = 'test_id'

Exercise 2: Check for potential problems with test assignments. For example Make sure there is no data obviously missing (This is an open ended question)

There is no dates missing during testing for each test id from below data.
    SELECT 
          DATE(event_time), 
          parameter_value AS test_id,
          COUNT(*) AS event_times
    FROM 
        dsv1069.events
    WHERE 
        event_name= 'test_assignment'
    AND 
        parameter_name = 'test_id'
    GROUP BY 
        DATE(event_time), test_id
