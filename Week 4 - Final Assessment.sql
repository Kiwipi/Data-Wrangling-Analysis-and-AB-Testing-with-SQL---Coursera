We are running an experiment at an item-level, which means all users who visit will see the same page, but the layout of different item pages may differ. Please follow the steps below and good luck!




4. Use the final_assignments table to calculate the view binary, and average views for the 30 day window after the test assignment for item_test_2. (You may include the day the test started)

5. Use the https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html
 to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence. 

6. Use Modeâ€™s Report builder feature to write up the test. Your write-up should include a title, a graph for each of the two binary metrics youâ€™ve calculated. The lift and p-value (from the AB test calculator) for each of the two metrics, and a complete sentence to interpret the significance of each of the results.


--We are running an experiment at an item-level, which means all users who visit will see the same page, but the layout of different item pages may differ.
--Compare this table to the assignment events we captured for user_level_testing.
--Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?
1. Compare the final_assignments_qa table to the assignment events we captured for user_level_testing. Write an answer to the following question: Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?

 SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  dsv1069.final_assignments_qa

 
 --Reformat the final_assignments_qa to look like the final_assignments table, filling in any missing values with a placeholder of the appropriate data type.
 2. Write a query and table creation statement to make final_assignments_qa look like the final_assignments table. If you discovered something missing in part 1, you may fill in the value with a place holder of the appropriate data type. 

SELECT 
  item_id,
  test_a AS test_assignment,
  (CASE WHEN test_a IS NOT NULL THEN 'test_a' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_number,
  (CASE WHEN test_a IS NOT NULL THEN '2013-01-05' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_start_date

3. Use the final_assignments table to calculate the order binary for the 30 day window after the test assignment for item_test_2 (You may include the day the test started)
