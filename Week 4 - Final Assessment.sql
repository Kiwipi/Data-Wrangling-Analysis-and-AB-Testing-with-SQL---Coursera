We are running an experiment at an item-level, which means all users who visit will see the same page, but the layout of different item pages may differ. Please follow the steps below and good luck!



6. Use Modeâ€™s Report builder feature to write up the test. Your write-up should include a title, a graph for each of the two binary metrics youâ€™ve calculated. The lift and p-value (from the AB test calculator) for each of the two metrics, and a complete sentence to interpret the significance of each of the results.


--We are running an experiment at an item-level, which means all users who visit will see the same page, but the layout of different item pages may differ.
--Compare this table to the assignment events we captured for user_level_testing.
--Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?
1. Compare the final_assignments_qa table to the assignment events we captured for user_level_testing. Write an answer to the following question: Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?

 SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  dsv1069.final_assignments_qa

 
 --Reformat the final_assignments_qa to look like the final_assignments table, filling in any missing values with a placeholder of the appropriate data type.
 2. Write a query and table creation statement to make final_assignments_qa look like the final_assignments table. If you discovered something missing in part 1, you may fill in the value with a place holder of the appropriate data type. 

SELECT 
  item_id,
  test_a AS test_assignment,
  (CASE WHEN test_a IS NOT NULL THEN 'test_a' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_number,
  (CASE WHEN test_a IS NOT NULL THEN '2013-01-05' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_start_date
FROM 
  dsv1069.final_assignments_qa
UNION 
SELECT 
  item_id,
  test_b AS test_assignment,
  (CASE WHEN test_b IS NOT NULL THEN 'test_b' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_number,
  (CASE WHEN test_b IS NOT NULL THEN '2013-01-05' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_start_date
FROM 
  dsv1069.final_assignments_qa
UNION 
SELECT 
  item_id,
  test_c AS test_assignment,
  (CASE WHEN test_c IS NOT NULL THEN 'test_c' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_number,
  (CASE WHEN test_c IS NOT NULL THEN '2013-01-05' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_start_date
FROM 
  dsv1069.final_assignments_qa
UNION 
SELECT 
  item_id,
  test_d AS test_assignment,
  (CASE WHEN test_d IS NOT NULL THEN 'test_d' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_number,
  (CASE WHEN test_d IS NOT NULL THEN '2013-01-05' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_start_date
FROM 
  dsv1069.final_assignments_qa
UNION 
SELECT 
  item_id,
  test_e AS test_assignment,
  (CASE WHEN test_e IS NOT NULL THEN 'test_e' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_number,
  (CASE WHEN test_e IS NOT NULL THEN '2013-01-05' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_start_date
FROM 
  dsv1069.final_assignments_qa
UNION 
SELECT 
  item_id,
  test_f AS test_assignment,
  (CASE WHEN test_f IS NOT NULL THEN 'test_f' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_number,
  (CASE WHEN test_f IS NOT NULL THEN '2013-01-05' ELSE NULL END ) AS test_start_date
FROM 
  dsv1069.final_assignments_qa


3. Use the final_assignments table to calculate the order binary for the 30 day window after the test assignment for item_test_2 (You may include the day the test started)
-- Use this table to 
-- compute order_binary for the 30 day window after the test_start_date
-- for the test named item_test_2

SELECT 
test_assignment,
COUNT (DISTINCT item_id) AS items_count,
SUM(order_binary) AS orders_after_tested
FROM
(
  SELECT 
    item_id,
    test_assignment,
    MAX (CASE WHEN created_at > test_start_date AND 
               DATE_PART('day', created_at - test_start_date) <=30
               THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS order_binary
FROM 
(
    SELECT 
      final_assignments.item_id, 
      final_assignments.test_assignment, 
      final_assignments.test_start_date,
      orders.created_at 
    FROM 
      dsv1069.final_assignments
    LEFT JOIN 
      dsv1069.orders
    ON 
      orders.item_id = final_assignments.item_id
    WHERE 
      final_assignments.test_number = 'item_test_2'
) all_item_2
GROUP BY 
    item_id,
    test_assignment
) order_binary
GROUP BY 
test_assignment

 Results: 
0	1130	341
1	1068	319

 -- Don't know why the result figures are not the same, anyone who can explain this?

4. Use the final_assignments table to calculate the view binary, and average views for the 30 day window after the test assignment for item_test_2. (You may include the day the test started)
-- Use this table to 
-- compute view_binary for the 30 day window after the test_start_date
-- for the test named item_test_2

SELECT 
  test_assignment,
  COUNT(DISTINCT item_id) AS total_items,
  SUM (view_binary ) AS total_views,
  AVG(view_binary ) AS avg_views
FROM 
(
  SELECT 
      final_assignments.item_id,
      final_assignments.test_assignment,
      final_assignments.test_number,
      MAX (CAST(CASE 
          WHEN (view_item.event_time > final_assignments.test_start_date AND 
                  DATE_PART('day', view_item.event_time - final_assignments.test_start_date) <=30 )
          THEN 1 
          ELSE 0 
          END AS INT) )AS view_binary
    FROM 
      dsv1069.final_assignments 
  LEFT JOIN 
  (  
      SELECT 
        event_time,
        (CASE WHEN parameter_name= 'item_id' THEN CAST (parameter_value AS INT) ELSE NULL END ) AS item_id
      FROM 
        dsv1069.events 
      WHERE 
        event_name = 'view_item'
  ) view_item
  ON 
    view_item.item_id = final_assignments.item_id
  WHERE
    final_assignments.test_number = 'item_test_2'
  GROUP BY 
    final_assignments.item_id,
    final_assignments.test_assignment,
    final_assignments.test_number
  ORDER BY 
    final_assignments.item_id 
    ) view_binary
GROUP BY 
  test_assignment

 RESULTS:
0	1130	918	0.8124
1	1068	890	0.8333


5. Use the https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html
 to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence.
