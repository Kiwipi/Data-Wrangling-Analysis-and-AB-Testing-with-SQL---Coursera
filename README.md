Throughout the course, I applied SQL skills to tackle four progressively intricate and authentic data science case studies. The hands-on experience included converting timestamps, optimizing JOIN operations, data cleaning through deduplication and quality checks, employing windowing functions for data segmentation, utilizing case statements for conditional logic, scheduling query jobs, inserting data into date partitions, and engineering features for predictive analysis. This practical application provided a robust framework for conducting real-world analysis, particularly for AB testing scenarios.
