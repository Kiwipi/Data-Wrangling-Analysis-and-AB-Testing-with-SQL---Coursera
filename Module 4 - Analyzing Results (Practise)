Exercise 1: Use the order_binary metric from the previous exercise, count the number of users per treatment group for test_id = 7, 
and count the number of users with orders (for test_id 7)



Exercise 2: Create a new tem view binary metric. Count the number of users per treatment group, and count the number of users with views (for test_id 7)



Exercise 3: Alter the result from EX 2, to compute the users who viewed an item WITHIN 30 days of their treatment event


Exercise 4:
Create the metric invoices (this is a mean metric, not a binary metric) and for test_id = 7
----The count of users per treatment group
----The average value of the metric per treatment group
----The standard deviation of the metric per treatment group
