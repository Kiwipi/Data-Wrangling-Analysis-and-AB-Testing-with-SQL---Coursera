    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS users_num
    FROM dsv1069.users


Exercise 1: Find out how many users have ever ordered

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT users.id) AS users_num_have_ordered
FROM dsv1069.users
JOIN dsv1069.orders
ON users.id = orders.user_id


Exercise 2:
--Goal find how many users have reordered the same item

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users_num_who_have_reordered
    FROM 
        (
        SELECT user_id, item_id, item_category, COUNT(DISTINCT line_item_id) AS times_ordered
        FROM dsv1069.orders
        GROUP BY  user_id, item_id, item_category
        ) times_ordered_table
    WHERE times_ordered_table.times_ordered >1

Exercise 3:
--Do users even order more than once?

    SELECT COUNT(user_id) AS users_num_ordered_multiple_times
    FROM 
        (
        SELECT user_id, COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_id) AS order_num
        FROM dsv1069.orders
        GROUP BY user_id
        ) order_num_table
    WHERE order_num_table.order_num >1
